## Top-down style
As we're a team of 4 people, we've chosen to follow the top-down style. We began to document our REST API with Swagger in yaml. Then :
* software quality engineers implement API tests.
* software developers implement the API on Spring Boot.

## Instruction for running automatised Mocha Tests
run `npm install` and `npm test` in nodejsTesting `directory`
